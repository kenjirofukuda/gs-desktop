- (void) setDocument: (NSDocument *)document
{

  // Cocoa Bindings makes many things easier. Unfortunately, one of the things it makes easier is creation of reference counting cycles. In Mac OS 10.4 and later NSWindowController has a feature that keeps bindings to File's Owner, when File's Owner is a window controller, from retaining the window controller in a way that would prevent its deallocation. We're setting up bindings programmatically in -windowDidLoad though, so that feature doesn't kick in, and we have to explicitly unbind to make sure this window controller and everything in the nib it owns get deallocated. We do this here instead of in an override of -[NSWindowController close] because window controllers aren't sent -close messages for every kind of window closing. Fortunately, window controllers are sent -setDocument:nil messages during window closing.
  if (!document)
    {
      [_graphicView unbind: SKTGraphicViewGraphicsBindingName];
    }

  // Redo the observing of the document's canvas size when the document changes. You would think we would just be able to observe self's "document.canvasSize" in -windowDidLoad or maybe even -init, but KVO wasn't really designed with observing of self in mind so things get a little squirrelly.
  [[self document] removeObserver: self forKeyPath: SKTDocumentCanvasSizeKey];
  [super setDocument: document];
  [[self document] addObserver: self forKeyPath: SKTDocumentCanvasSizeKey options:
                   NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context: SKTWindowControllerCanvasSizeObservationContext];

- (void) windowDidLoad

  // Do the regular Cocoa thing.

  // Set up the graphic view and its enclosing scroll view.
  NSScrollView *enclosingScrollView = [_graphicView enclosingScrollView];
  [enclosingScrollView setHasHorizontalRuler: YES];
  [enclosingScrollView setHasVerticalRuler: YES];

  // We're already observing the document's canvas size in case it changes, but we haven't been able to size the graphic view to match until now.
  [self observeDocumentCanvasSize: [(SKTDocument *)[self document] canvasSize]];

  [self addObserver: self forKeyPath: [NSString stringWithFormat: @"%@.%@", @"document",
                                       SKTDocumentGraphicsKey] options: 0 context: SKTWindowControllerGraphicsChanged];
  //[_graphicsController bind:NSContentArrayBinding toObject:self withKeyPath:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@.%@", @"document", SKTDocumentGraphicsKey] options:nil];

  // Bind the graphic view's selection indexes to the controller's selection indexes. The graphics controller's content array is bound to the document's graphics in the nib, so it knows when graphics are added and remove, so it can keep the selection indexes consistent.
  [_graphicView bind: SKTGraphicViewSelectionIndexesBindingName toObject: _graphicsController
                withKeyPath: @"selectionIndexes" options: nil];

  // Bind the graphic view's graphics to the document's graphics. We do this instead of binding to the graphics controller because NSArrayController is not KVC-compliant enough for "arrangedObjects" to work properly when the graphic view sends its bound-to object a -mutableArrayValueForKeyPath: message. The binding to self's "document.graphics" is 1) easy and 2) appropriate for a window controller that may someday be able to show one of several documents in its window. If we instead bound the graphic view to [self document] then we would have to redo the binding in -setDocument:.
  [_graphicView bind: SKTGraphicViewGraphicsBindingName toObject: self withKeyPath: [NSString
